# Hello, I am Mari! 🙋‍♀️

I am a Frontend Engineer with more than 5 years of experience, based in Melbourne, Australia. I'm specialized in building inclusive, web applications with a focus on React, TypeScript, and modern CSS architecture.

My background in History is my "secret weapon." It gives me a unique lens for technical documentation and a deep-seated empathy for the human stories behind the screens. I don't just build UI: I build sustainable, accessible systems designed to stand the test of time. My goal is to translate complex logic into intuitive journeys, anticipating a user's needs just as a teacher anticipates a student's question. I’m here to ensure that everyone, regardless of how they navigate the web, feels empowered and guided.

<summary><b>Beyond the Code</b></summary>
<br>

- 🗺️ **Global Side Quests**: I've lived in three countries! Brazil, New Zealand, and now Australia. I’m basically collecting countries like side quests and XP.

- 🖊️ **Analog Vibe**: I love collecting Gel pens! I have one for every mood, occasion, and minor life crisis.

- 🧱 **Brick by Brick**: I love LEGO! My shelves are home to a wild mix including the Simpsons House, the Yellow Submarine, and Rivendell. Up next? Conquering Sauron’s Tower and Bag End.

- 💍 **Middle-earth Resident**: My favorite trilogy is The Lord of the Rings! (Extended editions only, obviously). I can navigate the path to Mount Doom better than a GPS.

- 🧘‍♀️ **Zen Mode**: Tai Chi! It’s my favorite way to slow down and find my "zen" when life gets a little too fast.
